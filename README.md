Flight Delay Analysis
This repository contains code for analyzing flight delay data using various machine learning techniques. The analysis covers regression and classification tasks aimed at understanding and predicting flight delays, with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost associated with flight delays.

Introduction
Air travel is an essential mode of transportation, but flight delays can incur significant costs for airlines and inconvenience for passengers. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze flight delay data and develop models that can predict and potentially mitigate delays.
